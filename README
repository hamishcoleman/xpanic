Xpanic is a small program in the tradition of a certain guide to the
galaxy that pops up with a soothing message in large friendly letters
every now and again to relax you...

The program is tentatively (c) Robin Humble <rjh@pixel.maths.monash.edu.au>.
Feel free to mail me with any suggestions for improvements or bugs.

COMPILATION
-----------
On a modern system, with the X11 development libraries installed, just
compile with "make".  On Debian systems the X11 development libraries are
in the package "libx11-dev", which can be installed with "make build-deps"

Nix users can build it with `nix-shell -p gcc xorg.libX11 --run make'.

The original Imakefile is present, but xmkmf is not used on modern systems.
If needed modify the included Imakefile such that CC is defined as an ANSI C
compiler (e.g., gcc) and then run `xmkmf' and `make xpanic'.

INSTALLATION
------------
Move `xpanic' to where you normally keep binaries and `xpanic.man' to
where you normally keep manual pages for diversions like this.
